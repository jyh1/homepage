title: About Me
---

I am Yonghao Jin (靳永昊), a senior undergraduate from Department of Physics, [Universiy of Science and Technology of China(USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/). I am majoring in Applied physics, with concentration in Biophysics.

<!-- ### Background -->
I have diverse backgrounds in physics, computer science and biology. Having attended a complete undergraduate training in physics, I acquired a strong quantitative foundation and I am able to use math as a tool to analyze and address complicate problems.
I was first introduced to the world of computer science when I joined the informatics olympiad team in high school. Having spent nearly seven years in programming, I am adept in many programming contexts. In addition to completing the `National Olympiad Informatics in Province` with the first prize, I also wrote programming language interpreters, pipelines for analyzing high throughput sequencing data, physics simulation programs, computer games and so on. My recent project is a `Mathematica` language interpreter [mmaclone](https://github.com/jyh1/mmaclone).
Due to my concentration in biophysics, the required courses in biology covered many interesting topics in life sciences, like molecular biology, theoretical neurology and biochemistry, just to name a few. These interesting courses provided me with sufficient knowledge and understanding in biological processes.


I love the feeling of doing research. Currently, I am trying to integrate different sequencing-based RNA probing data to understand the binding preference of RNA binding proteins (RBP) under the supervision of Prof. Kun Qu.
I feel that my backgrounds set me in a unique position to apply statistics, mathematics and computer science to deciphering and interpreting the big data in life sciences.
I am applying for Ph.D. program in the fall of 2017.
